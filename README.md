# generic-video-game-data-structure
An ongoing class exercise for creating a meaningful data structure. It allows for the creation, deletion, and manipulation of different characters with different abilities and skill sets, each with their own variables and inventories.

## future changes

I plan on removing the custom dictionaly data structure in favor of using std::map which has already been implemented and will theoretically be faster (and simpler). I need to outright remove the dictionary.hpp file as well as modify any files that used it so that they use the new method.
