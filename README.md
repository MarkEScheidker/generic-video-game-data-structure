# generic-video-game-data-structure
An ongoing class exercise for creating a meaningful data structure. It allows for the creation, deletion, and manipulation of different characters with different abilities and skill sets, each with their own variables and inventories.

## future changes

I have added most of the code necessary for implementing std::map instead of the old dictionaty method. There's only one compiler error on line 15 of the inventory.cpp file but I plan on fixing that soon. a small change has been made to my gitignore to include the database json files necessary to run the code. I also haven't outright removed the old files yet, just commented out any mentions of them in the files, so they shouldn't be used or even recognized.
