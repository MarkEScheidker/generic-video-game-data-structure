# generic-video-game-data-structure
An ongoing class exercise for creating a meaningful data structure. It allows for the creation, deletion, and manipulation of different characters with different abilities and skill sets, each with their own variables and inventories.

## future changes

I might add a few more changes down the line to better utilize the std::map library, but other than that, unless I end up using this code again for another project, I can't see anything worth changing other than adding more features if needed.
